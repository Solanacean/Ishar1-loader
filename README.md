# Ishar: Legend of the Fortress loader
This loader for Ishar: Legend of the Fortress removes the pointless and utterly annoying copy protection as well as the stupid requirement to pay gold to save. It is compatible with the version of the game being sold by GOG.

## Installing
Just copy ishar1.com to the folder where the game was installed, open dosboxishar1.conf in your favorite text editor, replace 'start.exe' in the autoexec section of the dosbox configuration file with 'ishar1.com' and save the changes.

## Building from source code
To build it from source code you'll need MASM, JWASM or [UASM.](http://www.terraspace.co.uk/uasm.html)
